## Implementation

 1)**Main Menu**: Used to start new game, or load any saved game, to open game rules/instructions, to open leaderboard for highest score, and
   to select day/night mode.
 2) On starting a new game, player is taken to the game screen, with different kind of multi-colored obstacles containing stars.
 3) On loading a saved game, player is taken to the game screen with the player ball and obstacles at exact positions where game was left.
 4)**Game screen**: Contains current score, stars collected, and highest score, obstacles and player ball.
 5) Star collection : Each time the player collides with a star, it is added to the playerâ€™s star count for that particular game, and score is
 incremented by 1.
 6) Game screen has 3 levels with obstacles of increasing difficulty based on playerâ€™s score. Incorporated 74 different scenes with combinations of 13 different
   Obstacles for the sake of variety. The Easy Scenes can be maneuvered by the user, after reaching a certain score, we designed an algorithm where the player would be taken to    a scene of higher difficulty.
   a) Scenes Easy - 6 obstacles : Circle , Square , Rhombus , Vertical Lines , Horizontal Lines , Plus Sign
   b) Scenes Medium - 6 Obstacles : Concentric Circles (2) , Concentric Squares (2) , Concentric Rhombuses (2) , Vertical Lines ,
   Horizontal Lines , Plus Sign
   c) Scenes Difficult - 6 Obstacles : Concentric Circles (3) , Concentric Squares (3) , Horizontal Lines ( 3 ) , Vertical Lines , Horizontal
   Lines ( 2 parallel lines ) , Plus Sign
 7)**Pause Menu**: Player can press â€˜Pâ€™ to pause game at any time. Option available in pause menu are: resume game, restart game, to open
 game rules/instructions, and exit to main menu.
 8)**Save Game and Restart Game options** : Player can save multiple game states. Player can also restart the same game at any point of time.
 9) Game End Alert Box: On collision with an obstacle of color other than that of player, the game end alert box is thrown with following
 options: resurrect, restart game, open game rules/instructions, and exit to main menu.
 10)**Resurrection**: Player can resurrect if number of starts collected >=10, and a new game with same score but 10 stars deducted would be
 started.
 
 ## Design Patterns
 
 1) Singleton- For the database, as we need only one reference throughout the game.
 2) Iterator - To ensure that collection of Stars and Obstacles are accessed in a synchronized way.
 3) Factory- To create objects of Scenes class (ScenesEasy+ScenesMedium+ScenesDifficult).
 
 ## Threading : 
 All the Animations are done using AnimationTimer , each of which is an individual thread in JVM.
